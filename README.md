# Predictive-Maintenance-System
OOPs project

Description: Develop a predictive maintenance application for Caterpillar machinery using simulated sensor data.
OOP Concepts:
o Abstraction: Create abstract sensor classes like TemperatureSensor, PressureSensor, and VibrationSensor.
o Composition: Combine multiple sensors into a MachineHealthMonitor class.
Design Patterns: Apply the Factory Pattern for creating sensor objects and the Decorator Pattern to add new features like alerts or logging.
o File Handling: Store machine logs in files for further analysis.
